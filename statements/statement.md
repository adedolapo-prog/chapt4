**What is an Expression?**
====
An expression is any unit of code that can be evaluated to give a value. The expression can be a snippet of code or a single value itself as long as it evaluates to give a value. 
There are different categories of expressions. Some are:

- **Arithmetic expressions:** these are expressions that evaluate to give a numeric value. Examples of arithmetic expressions include: 10, 21 + 13, i + 2 and so on. These only give numbers as the output hence the term arithmetic expressions.

- **String expressions:** these evaluate to give a string value. Examples include "Hello", "Good " + "morning".

- **Logical expressions:** these give out boolean expressions true or false as their value. Examples include 10 > 5, age == 18, etc

Other categories of expression include:
- *Primary expressions*
- *Left Hand side expressions*

**What is a Statement?**
===
A statement is a block of code that performs an action. It is an instruction to execute an action. Statements can span over multiple lines. Statements usually contain one or more different expressions. Such statements could include creating a variable or function, looping through an array, evaluating codes based on a specific condition etc. Programs are usually composed of multiple statements. Example of a statement is the If statement. There are also various types of statements some of which are listed below:
- **Loop Statement:** A loop is a series of commands that continue to execute until a specified condition is met. We have the for, do...while and while loops.

- **Conditional Statement:** this is the set of commands that execute if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch.

- **Declaration statement:** this assigns a value to a variable name. We use the "const" and "let" keywords.

- **Miscellaneous Statement:** example of a miscellaneous statement is the return function which returns a value from a function thereby ending the execution of the function.


**Differences between Expressions and Statements**
---

There are a few differences to note between an expression and a statement. An expression is evaluated to give a specified value while a statement is a unit of code that performs an action. A statement usually consists of a series of expressions.

**FUNCTIONS**
===
This is a series of statements written to execute a particular task. It is a way to execute a command over and over across various aspects of the code without writing the same piece of code over and over again. We simply write the function code once and call it once we want it to be executed at a particular point in the code. Functions accept inputs and we call these inputs parameters. There are three different types of functions which are:
- **Named function:** this is a function that can be called in various parts of the code by just typing the name of the function along with a (). 
- **Anonymous function:** this is a function that is not named and usually executed immediately after it is declared. However, it can be assigned to a variable in order to be called in other parts of the code.
- **Immediately Invoked Function:** this is a function that runs as soon as the browser encounters them.
